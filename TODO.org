#+TITLE: spunk is literally the best name ever

* strategy
** specify lexing and parsing in same objects, perform in one swoop
** can parse more than just text: can parse arbitrary javascript objects
** specify method for putting together structure from inputs so semantic actions aren't required
** but also have plenty of hooks at both lexing and parsing stages
** user gives NFAs -> turn into DFAs?
** user specifies as string -> we parse into grammar
*** lol let's make a regex parser
